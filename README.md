# arby
**A** **R**eally **B**asic **Data Serialization Language**

## Goals

Make a data serialization language with similar syntax to YAML but without all the super complicated parts of YAML.

**ARBY** is about legibility and simplicity so it only uses the most basic features of YAML where you can specify
- Objects
- Arrays
- Literal values (numbers, strings, enums, etc.)
